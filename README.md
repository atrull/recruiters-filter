Alex's (Mostly) English-Language Recruiter Domain List.

A great big dirty mailfilter to handle the recruiter spam / feed a jobs mailbox. Domains collected from various sources including my own filters.

I don't consider these people spammers. Sometimes when you don't have a job you'd like to hear from them!!

You can use domains.txt raw. You can see how I build up a little maildrop filter with it via the other files.

wildcards.txt is created based on a few simple tld/word inputs and also covers the two recruitment GTLDS.

Please contact me if you have any suggestions or want a better filter for your x/y/z.
